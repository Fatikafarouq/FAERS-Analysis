# FAERS Data Analysis
This repository contains code and analysis exploring data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The FAERS database is a post-marketing safety surveillance program for drug and therapeutic biologic products. Understanding reported adverse events is crucial for monitoring drug safety.
## Goal
The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate various methods for analyzing FAERS data to extract meaningful insights regarding reported adverse events. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Identifying drugs with the highest number of reported side effects.
*   Analyzing the most frequently reported reactions for specific drugs.
*   Exploring potential relationships between drugs and adverse events.
*   Providing reproducible code examples for working with large pharmacovigilance datasets.

This analysis aims to provide a starting point for understanding patterns in drug safety reports using publicly available data.


## Future Improvements

This repository is a living project, and there are many avenues for future analysis and improvement:

*   **Expand Drug Coverage:** Analyze a wider range of drugs beyond the initial examples (e.g., specific therapeutic classes, drugs with recent safety concerns).
*   **Detailed Reaction Analysis:** Investigate specific types of reactions (e.g., serious adverse events, specific organ system effects).
*   **Temporal Analysis:** Analyze trends in adverse event reporting over time.
*   **Patient Demographics:** Incorporate patient demographic data (if available and appropriate) to see if certain populations are more affected.
*   **Drug-Drug Interactions:** Explore potential adverse events associated with the co-administration of multiple drugs.
*   **Data Integration:** Integrate data from other sources (e.g., drug labeling information, scientific literature) to provide richer context.
*   **Advanced Visualizations:** Create more interactive or complex visualizations to explore relationships in the data.
*   **Machine Learning Applications:** Explore using machine learning techniques for signal detection or predicting potential adverse events.
*   **Code Optimization:** Refine code for efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.
*   **Add More Notebooks/Analyses:** Include additional notebooks demonstrating different analysis techniques or focusing on different research questions.

Contributions and suggestions for further analysis are welcome!
